// there are two untitled meets involving Georgia in March 2023 (their 10th & 11th meets, which were also Arkansas' 9th and Michigan's 10th, respectively). They had to do some emergency repairs to their arena so they went to a semi-neutral site nearby... so they /kinda/ hosted, but not enough to mark them as hosts (for the purposes of this project) or to title the meet. their event_meet_id made below is still unique for both of the meets due to the different dates of the meets and due to those two meets being the only two (untitled & no-host) meets in the sample.


***********************************************
*final formatting: reshape & numeric ids & save
***********************************************
// now we'd like to generate a string that uniquely identifies events within meets, but it needs a reshape:
rename (vault bars beam floor) (score1 score2 score3 score4)
reshape long score, i(meettitle date host gymnast) j(event)
drop if score==. // good stuff, now let's move along:

*label the events (these export to string in csv format)
label define event_lbl 1 "Vault" 2 "Uneven Bars" 3 "Balance Beam" 4 "Floor Exercise"
label values event event_lbl


*and now we're done!
compress
sort team year meetnum event score
export delimited using "${route}/cleaned_scores.csv", replace // and we're done!
